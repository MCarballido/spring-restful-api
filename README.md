# [Demo] Spring Boot RESTful API
Demo of a RESTful API built with Java and the Spring Framework ecosystem. This will serve as a skeleton for future projects that I will develop using these technologies. It will include the fundamental structure that a secure and scalable server needs to build upon. Because of this, the structure and source code of this repository will probably shift in the future as I investigate and learn the better ways to manage and develop a server with these technologies.

This is aimed to be a standalone server that I will use to connect to clients with loose coupling, applying techniques such as HATEOAS to create clean, maintainable and scalable applications in the future by using this skeleton (as well as a future frontend skeleton with React).

Technologies (and soon to be) used so far:

- Java (of course)
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring MVC
- Spring HATEOAS
- Spring Security
- Hibernate
- PostgreSQL
