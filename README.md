# [Demo] Spring Boot RESTful API
Demo of a RESTful API built with Java and the Spring Framework ecosystem. This will serve as a skeleton for future projects that I will develop using these technologies. It will include the fundamental structure that a secure and scalable server needs to build upon. Because of this, the structure and source code of this repository will probably shift in the future as I investigate and learn the better ways to manage and develop a server with these technologies and fundamentals.

This is aimed to be a standalone server that I will use as a server structure for future web projects to connect to whilst maintaining loose coupling and modularity. I will be applying techniques such as HATEOAS and OOP design patterns to create clean, maintainable code to provide a scalable solution for future uses.

Of course, most of the job will include investigating, which is the main task and therefore a big personal challenge.

Technologies (and soon to be) used so far:

- Java (of course)
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring MVC
- Spring HATEOAS
- Spring Security
- Hibernate
- PostgreSQL
